	abstract = {Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) are a class of parallel mechanisms known for their large workspace. In practice, the cable tension range of drive unit is a critical factor for their practical workspace. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel elastic drive unit (PE-DU), where a spring and a variableradius drum are connected in parallel with the motor to generate additional passive tension on the cable. The passive tension expands and regulates the cable tension range, thereby increasing the wrench-feasible workspace (WFW). To meets the workspace requirements, this paper presents an optimal design method that optimizes the dimensional parameters of PE-DUs while ensuring the feasibility of the required wrench set throughout the desired workspace. Simulation conducted on an eight-cable CDPR demonstrates that the proposed design method of PE-DUs effectively meets workspace requirements. The implementation of PE-DUs results in a significant increase in the WFW, more than doubling the capacity of motors in conventional drive units. Moreover, with the assistance of passive tension, PEDUs can reduce energy consumption while ensuring robust tension distribution, offering another substantial improvement over conventional drive units.},

However, they are costly to develop, and once developed, SGs become dependent on software and hardware combinations that may become obsolete, such as Adobe Flash or Java Applets. Addressing these problems would allow a much greater use of SGs in education. The eAdventure authoring tool, developed by the e-UCM research group, addressed high development costs, and resulted in the creation of multiple SGs in collaboration with different institutions. However, eAdventure's Java Applets have become increasingly difficult to run due to platform obsolescence. To maintain the benefits of the eAdventure platform and user base, we have created new platform called uAdventure: an SG editor built on top of the game engine Unity that allows for the creation of educational adventure games without requiring programming. Since Unity is supported on a majority of platforms (including mobile). By developing SGs with uAdventure, the games become future-proof, as they can be updated and retargeted for new platforms as required. In this sense, uAdventure improves the lifecycle of SGs by reducing both authoring and maintenance costs.},

However, despite their potential benefits when compared to traditional e-learning, use of serious games in education has been hampered by difficulties, including that of deploying games in multi-platform settings and leveraging data generated by their players to improve the learning outcomes of those players. This increasing uptake requires to simplify serious games application for both teachers and developers. This paper proposes a standards-based approach to improve serious games deployment and evaluation. Building on existing and upcoming standards will allow games to be seamlessly integrated into the learning management systems that are already present in most higher education institutions.

	abstract = {Serious games are videogames whose purpose goes beyond mere entertainment. However, serious games use in mainstream education is still limited. The development of serious games is an expensive and complex process that requires the participation of different experts (e.g. domain, educators, graphic artists, and programmers). We consider that new generative AI techniques can help in the prototyping of serious games by reducing and automating some of the processes involved. There is increasing evidence that generative AI techniques such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can increase the productivity of writing or coding tasks respectively. In our case, both prototyping and teaching serious games are complex because of the number and diversity of tasks involved and we are currently investigating whether AI techniques can be used to improve and simplify the process. For example, ChatGPT could support the process of creating the game narrative, and other systems such as Stable Diffusion could ease the creation of some of the graphics resources (e.g., for creating more cohesive and coherent backgrounds). Automating some of the costlier processes of game prototyping can contribute to creating better products by allowing the playtesting of different options for more effective games. As the field of generative AI is in continuous change, this paper presents a working methodology to simplify the development of serious games, that has been instantiated with concrete tools. This working methodology has been piloted effectively by one student from a Master of Design for the development of a serious game and will be tested in a serious games development course. In the article we also explore how these AI techniques can be combined with a game authoring environment such as uAdventure to systematize the development of serious games. The use of Generative AI offers great potential for improving the development of serious games and needs to be further researched alongside its applications for game-based learning education.},

The idea is to get most of the advantages of the Unity professional environment at a fraction of its complexity, and without requiring programming knowledge to use it. uAdventure include educational-oriented affordances, such as assessment and learning analytics; and has been formatively evaluated by heterogeneous users with different degrees of technical knowledge. The results of our evaluation show much simpler story creation for profiles that had no previous knowledge of the engine, and positive feedback from more technical profiles which would use the tool as a prototyping tool for complex projects.},

	abstract = {Achieving a fast transient response and high steadystate tracking accuracy of joint torque for flexible joint systems with dynamic constraints, various parameter uncertainties, and uncertain nonlinearities is always challenging. To this end, a torque control scheme based on multi-torque sensors is proposed. By analyzing and transforming the joint dynamics, a lumped disturbance signal, including the reducer drive’s torque loss, is constructed, which can be measured by the torque sensors. Then, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) and an adaptive robust torque control (ARTC) law are introduced to synthesize the control scheme, where NDOB estimates the motor’s friction, and ARTC realizes the stable tracking of the joint torque. The performance of the proposed controller is theoretically ensured by Lyapunov analysis. Finally, a series of hardware experiments are carried out. The results suggest the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method for joint torque control by comparing it with other traditional methods.},

A learning-based control algorithm is proposed to compensate for uncertainties due to cable elasticity, mechanical friction, etc. A basic control law is given for the nominal model, and a Lyapunov-based deep reinforcement learning control law is designed. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop tracking system under the reinforcement learning algorithm is proved. Both simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control algorithm.},

Then, the corresponding dynamics model is established by adopting the Fossen approach for the prediction and optimization of the control process. To achieve autonomous control, an MPC-based controller is designed and implemented to calculate the control input for the speciﬁed control objective. Finally, way-point tracking and trajectorytracking experiments are carried out in an indoor tank equipped with a motion capture system to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the robot’s design and control framework. In addition, the robustness of the robot system is veriﬁed by artiﬁcially perturbing the robot in the hovering state.},

The command-ﬁlter backstepping method is combined with ﬁxed-time control to design the control input. A ﬁxed-time disturbance-observer is designed to compensate for the external unknown disturbance in the systems. It is shown that all the signals in the closed-loop system are ﬁxed-time bounded. The simulation study conﬁrms effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

This paper focuses on n-DOF CDPRs driven by n+2 cables since, for n = 6, these redundantly actuated CDPRs are relevant in many applications. The set of feasible cable tensions of n-DOF n+2-cable CDPRs is a two-dimensional convex polygon. An algorithm that determines the vertices of this polygon in a clockwise or counterclockwise order is ﬁrst introduced. This algorithm is efﬁcient and can deal with infeasibility. It is then pointed out that straightforward modiﬁcations of this algorithm allow the determination of various (optimal) cable tension distributions. A self-contained and versatile tension distribution algorithm is thereby obtained. Moreover, the worst-case maximum number of iterations of this algorithm is established. Based on this result, its computational cost is analyzed in detail, showing that the algorithm is efﬁcient and real-time compatible even in the worst case. Finally, experiments on two 6-DOF 8-cable CDPR prototypes are reported.},

The semi-direct approach eliminates the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points. Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle state-estimation in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our implementation as open-source software.},

The framework is very ﬂexible thanks to its modular structure, which allows for an easy integration of new metrics, target devices and evaluation scenarios. It consists of two modules that can currently asses the performance of lightweight block and stream ciphers on three widely used microcontrollers: 8-bit AVR, 16-bit MSP and 32-bit ARM. The metrics extracted are execution time, RAM consumption and binary code size. FELICS has a simple user interface and is intended to be used by cipher designers to compare new primitives with the state of the art. The extracted metrics are very detailed and assist embedded software engineers in selecting the best cipher to match the requirements of a particular application. The tool aims to increase the transparency and trust in benchmarking results of lightweight primitives and facilitates a fair comparison between diﬀerent primitives using the same evaluation conditions.},

	abstract = {The PRESENT block cipher was one of the ﬁrst hardwareoriented proposals for implementation in extremely resource-constrained environments. Its design is based on 4-bit S-boxes and a 64-bit permutation, a far from optimal choice to achieve good performance in software. As a result, most software implementations require large lookup tables in order to meet eﬃciency goals. In this paper, we describe a new portable and eﬃcient software implementation of PRESENT, fully protected against timing attacks. Our implementation uses a novel decomposition of the permutation layer, and bitsliced computation of the S-boxes using optimized Boolean formulas, not requiring lookup tables. The implementations are evaluated in embedded ARM CPUs ranging from microcontrollers to full-featured processors equipped with vector instructions. Timings for our software implementation show a signiﬁcant performance improvement compared to the numbers from the FELICS benchmarking framework. In particular, encrypting 128 bits using CTR mode takes about 2100 cycles on a Cortex-M3, improving on the best Assembly implementation in FELICS by a factor of 8. Additionally, we present the fastest masked implementation of PRESENT for protection against timing and other side-channel attacks in the scenario we consider, improving on related work by 15\%. Hence, we conclude that PRESENT can be remarkably eﬃcient in software if implemented with our techniques, and even compete with a software implementation of AES in terms of latency while oﬀering a much smaller code footprint.},

The Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, distributed control systems, vehicular systems, wireless sensor networks, tele-medicine, and the smart grid are a few examples of these ﬁelds. In any of these contexts, security and privacy might be essential aspects. Research on secure communication in Internet of Things (IoT) networks is a highly contested topic. One method for ensuring secure data transmission is cryptography. Because IoT devices have limited resources, such as power, memory, and batteries, IoT networks have boosted the term “lightweight cryptography”. Algorithms for lightweight cryptography are designed to efﬁciently protect data while using minimal resources. In this research, we evaluated and benchmarked lightweight symmetric ciphers for resource-constrained devices. The evaluation is performed using two widely used platform: Arduino and Raspberry Pi. In the ﬁrst part, we implemented 39 block ciphers on an ATMEGA328p microcontroller and analyzed them in the terms of speed, cost, and energy efﬁciency during encryption and decryption for different block and key sizes. In the second part, the 2nd-round NIST candidates (80 stream and block cipher algorithms) were added to the ﬁrst-part ciphers in a comprehensive analysis for equivalent block and key sizes in the terms of latency and energy efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {In recent years, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors (3D accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes) have become widely available due to their small size and low cost. Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suﬀer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss diﬀerent modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and ﬁltering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman ﬁlter and complementary ﬁlter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

By itself, this data is subject to signiﬁcant noise, bias, and drift (without constant re-calibration). A data fusion algorithm can be applied to signiﬁcantly reduce these errors. In the past, many approaches have been adopted for ﬁltering gyroscope data with inertial measurements, and the most commonly used techniques are Extended Kalman ﬁltering and complementary ﬁlters. Thus, this paper compares three methods: two complementary ﬁlters known as Madgwick and Mahony, and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Simulation experiments are conducted using quadcopter data and results show that Mahony provides better orientation estimation than both Madgwick and EKF when using optimum parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of visual target tracking in scenarios where a pursuer may experience intermittent loss of visibility of the target. The design of a Switched Visual Tracker (SVT) is presented which aims to meet the competing requirements of maintaining both proximity and visibility. SVT alternates between a visual tracking mode for following the target, and a recovery mode for regaining visual contact when the target falls out of sight. We establish the stability of SVT by extending the average dwell time theorem from switched systems theory, which may be of independent interest. Our implementation of SVT on an Agilicious drone [1] illustrates its effectiveness on tracking various target trajectories: it reduces the average tracking error by up to 45\% and significantly improves visibility duration compared to a baseline algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles intermittent vision loss, offering enhanced robustness and adaptability for real-world autonomous missions. Additionally, we demonstrate how the stability analysis provides valuable guidance for selecting parameters, such as tracking speed and recovery distance, to optimize the SVT ’s performance.},

	abstract = {As autonomous driving technology advances, the integration of LiDAR and camera sensors is becoming increasingly crucial for precise environmental perception in automated driving systems. Accurate extrinsic calibration is essential for this integration. Recent approaches leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and point cloud consistency for LiDAR-camera calibration have made significant progress in addressing challenges such as dataset limitations and poor transferability in deep learning methods. The enhanced SAM2 model features a refined architecture, streaming memory, and more efficient attention mechanisms, which together improve mask prediction accuracy and processing speed. These precise masks are incorporated into a novel LiDAR-camera calibration framework. To reduce data complexity, we voxelize the raw point cloud, resulting in more accurate point cloud attributes. Additionally, we enhance the consistency of projected points in each mask image by conducting correlation analysis on RGB image high-level semantic feature within a consistency function. Finally, we optimize the extrinsic parameters by minimizing reprojection errors based on consistency scores, using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and a crossmodal distance measurement technique based on normalized information distance. Validation on the KITTI dataset shows that our method achieves comparable accuracy, significantly advancing sensor fusion techniques for autonomous driving systems.},

	abstract = {Wheeled-legged robots offer signiﬁcant mobility and versatility but face substantial challenges when operating on slippery terrains. Traditional model-based controllers for these robots assume no slipping. While reinforcement learning (RL) helps quadruped robots adapt to different surfaces, recovering from slips remains challenging, especially for systems with few contact points. Estimating the ground friction coefﬁcient is another open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel friction-aware safety locomotion framework that integrates Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) with a RL policy. Our approach explicitly incorporates the estimated friction coefﬁcient into the RL policy, enabling the robot to adapt its behavior in advance based on the surface type before reaching it. We introduce a Friction-From-Vision (FFV) module, which leverages LVLMs to estimate ground friction coefﬁcients, eliminating the need for large datasets and extensive training. The framework was validated on a customized wheeled inverted pendulum, and experimental results demonstrate that our framework increases the success rate in completing driving tasks by adjusting speed according to terrain type, while achieving better tracking performance compared to baseline methods. Our framework can be simply integrated with any other RL policies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of an uncalibrated visual servoing (UVS) control strategy for a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) system. CDPRs are known for their large workspaces and high payloadto-weight ratios, making them ideal for various applications. However, traditional control strategies typically rely on extensive calibration processes, which are impractical in changing or unstructured environments. To overcome this limitation, we implemented UVS to control the CDPR platform by leveraging real-time visual feedback without the need for prior calibration. The system employs a three-cable CDPR equipped with an eye-in-hand camera configuration for visual tracking of ArUco markers. We conducted experiments comparing three control strategies—Cartesian, Single Point UVS, and Three Points UVS—in terms of their accuracy in tracking markers across a workspace. Our results show that the Cartesian control method exhibited the lowest error rates, while the Three Points method, though theoretically more robust, struggled with alignment accuracy. The Single Point method performed moderately well but was consistently outperformed by the Cartesian approach. These findings suggest that UVS is a viable alternative to traditional calibrated approaches, especially for applications requiring flexibility and rapid deployment in unpredictable environments. Future work will explore further refinements to the multi-point tracking methods and the integration of adaptive control techniques to improve the system's overall robustness.},

	abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was done on the propeller design of a micro aerial vehicle (quadrotor-typed) to optimize its aerodynamic performance via Shear Stress Transport K-Omega (SST k-ω) turbulence model. The quadrotor model used was WL-V303 Seeker. The design process started with airfoils selection and followed by the evaluation of drone model in hovering and cruising conditions. To sustain a 400g payload, by Momentum Theory an ideal thrust of 5.4 N should be generated by each rotor of the quadrotor and this resulted in an induced velocity of 7.4 m/s on the propeller during hovering phase, equivalent to Reynolds number of 10403 at 75\% of the propeller blade radius. There were 6 propellers investigated at this Reynolds number. Sokolov airfoil which produced the largest lift-to-drag ratio was selected for full drone installation to be compared with the original model (benchmark). The CFD results showed that the Sokolov propeller generated 0.76 N of thrust more than the benchmark propeller at 7750 rpm. Despite generating higher thrust, higher drag was also experienced by the drone installed with Sokolov propellers. This resulted in lower lift-to-drag ratio than the benchmark propellers. It was also discovered that the aerodynamic performance of the drone could be further improved by changing the rotating direction of each rotor. Without making changes on the structural design, the drone performance increased by 39.58\% in terms of lift-to-drag ratio by using this method.},

The prototype is firstly static-bench tested to match its nominal and physical models, followed by hovering tests in multiple orientations. The presented prototype shows the ability to fly horizontally, upside down and at a tilted angle.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades quaternions have become a crucial and very successful tool for attitude representation in robotics and aerospace. However, there is a major problem that is continuously causing trouble in practice when it comes to exchanging formulas or implementations: there are two quaternion multiplications in common use, Hamilton's original multiplication and its flipped version, which is often associated with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We believe that this particular issue is completely avoidable and only exists today due to a lack of understanding. This paper explains the underlying problem for the popular passive world to body usage of rotation quaternions, and derives an alternative solution compatible with Hamilton's multiplication. Furthermore, it argues for entirely discontinuing the flipped multiplication. Additionally, it provides recipes for efficiently detecting relevant conventions and migrating formulas or algorithms between them.},

	abstract = {A quaternion feedback regulator is developed for spacecraft eigenaxis rotational maneuvers. The Euler's eigenaxis rotation that provides the shortest angular path between two orientations is considered as an 'optimal' maneuver. The control algorithm basically consists of linear feedback of error quaternions and body rates, and includes decoupling control torque that counteracts the natural gyroscopic coupling torque. But, in some cases with small angular rates, the gyroscopic decoupling control is not necessary for eigenaxis rotations. It is shown that large-angle, rest-to-rest maneuver about the Euler's eigenaxis can be simply achieved by a proper selection of feedback gain matrices of the quaternion feedback regulator. Furthermore, previous results in quaternion feedback stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method are significantly extended. Robustness of the globally stable, quaternion feedback regulator to spacecraft inertia matrix uncertainty is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Quadrotors are among the most agile flying robots. However, planning time-optimal trajectories at the actuation limit through multiple waypoints remains an open problem. This is crucial for applications such as inspection, delivery, search and rescue, and drone racing. Early works used polynomial trajectory formulations, which do not exploit the full actuator potential because of their inherent smoothness. Recent works resorted to numerical optimization but require waypoints to be allocated as costs or constraints at specific discrete times. However, this time allocation is a priori unknown and renders previous works incapable of producing truly time-optimal trajectories. To generate truly time-optimal trajectories, we propose a solution to the time allocation problem while exploiting the full quadrotor's actuator potential. We achieve this by introducing a formulation of progress along the trajectory, which enables the simultaneous optimization of the time allocation and the trajectory itself. We compare our method against related approaches and validate it in real-world flights in one of the world's largest motion-capture systems, where we outperform human expert drone pilots in a drone-racing task.},

In the context of attitude control of micro air vehicles, incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion only uses a control effectiveness model and uses estimates of the angular accelerations to replace the rest of the model. This paper provides solutions for two major challenges of incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion control: how to deal with measurement and actuator delays, and how to deal with a changing control effectiveness. The main contributions of this article are 1) a proposed method to correctly take into account the delays occurring when deriving angular accelerations from angular rate measurements; 2) the introduction of adaptive incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion, which can estimate the control effectiveness online, eliminating the need for manual parameter estimation or tuning; and 3) the incorporation of the momentum of the propellers in the controller. This controller is suitable for vehicles that experience a different control effectiveness across their flight envelope. Furthermore, this approach requires only very coarse knowledge of model parameters in advance. Real-world experiments show the high performance, disturbance rejection, and adaptiveness properties.},

The quadrotor's dynamics are modeled using a hybrid systems approach and, specifically, a set of piecewise affine (PWA) systems around different operating points of the translational and rotational motions. The proposed control scheme is dual and consists of an integral MPC for the translational motions, followed by an MPC scheme for the tracking of the quadrotor's attitude motions. By the utilization of PWA representations, the controller is computed for a larger part of the quadrotor's flight envelope, which provides more control authority for aggressive maneuvering. The proposed dual control scheme is able to calculate optimal control actions with robustness against atmospheric disturbances (e.g. wind gusts) and with respect to the physical constraints of the quadrotor (e.g. maximum lifting forces or fixed thrust limitations in order to extend flight endurance). Extended simulation studies indicate the efficiency of the MPC scheme, both in trajectory tracking and aerodynamic disturbance attenuation.},

The proposed approach combines the standard hierarchical control paradigm that separates the control into low-level motor control, mid-level attitude dynamics control, and a high-level trajectory tracking with a model predictive control strategy. We use dynamic reduction of the attitude dynamics and dynamic extension of the thrust control along with feedback linearisation to obtain a linear system of relative degree three that models force controlled position and trajectory tracking for the quadrotor. Model predictive control is then used on the feedback equivalent system and its control outputs are transformed back into the inputs for the original system. The proposed structure leads to a low complexity model predictive control algorithm that is implemented in real-time on an embedded hardware. Experimental results on different position and trajectory tracking control are presented to illustrate the application of the derived linear system and controllers.},

This approach can be of use when investigating different multirotor architectures’ characteristics and control algorithms for them, avoiding spending effort on attitude planning and control allocation for each different case. The framework is compared to current solutions by pointing out the advantages of the approach used here. Simulation results of three different architectures are presented aiming to explore the algorithm’s robustness, without change, to arbitrary and non-symmetric rotor positions; under, fully or over-actuated architectures; and differently-sized rotors.},

The paper shows that global exponential stability of a quadrotor can be achieved with the proposed control scheme. The presented controller includes feedback and feedforward compensation of the nonlinear dynamics of the quadrotor and gyroscopic torques to guarantee global stability of the attitude controller. The outer velocity control loop uses a PI feedback structure, where the proportional action is primarily used to control linear velocity, and the integral action can either be used for linear position and/or eliminating velocity steady-state error. The inner attitude control includes a PD feedback loop, where the proportional action is in terms of the vector part of the quaternion and the derivative action is in terms of the aircraft angular velocity. The proposed controller has been both simulated and tested experimentally with a commercial quadrotor.},

However, this is challenging in agile ﬂights due to nonlinear dynamics, complex aerodynamic effects, and actuation constraints. In this article, we empirically compare two state-of-the-art control frameworks: the nonlinear-model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the differential-ﬂatness-based controller (DFBC), by tracking a wide variety of agile trajectories at speeds up to 20 m/s (i.e., 72 km/h). The comparisons are performed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efﬁciency. We show the superiority of the NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical convergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect of adding an inner loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model. Our real-world experiments, performed in one of the world’s largest motion capture systems, demonstrate more than 78\% tracking error reduction of both NMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner loop controller and aerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.},

State-of-the-art solutions split the problem into a planning task—where a global time-optimal trajectory is generated—and a control task—where this trajectory is accurately tracked. However, at the current state, generating a time-optimal trajectory that considers the full quadrotor model requires solving a difﬁcult time allocation problem via optimization, which is computationally demanding (in the order of minutes or even hours). This is detrimental for replanning in the presence of disturbances. We overcome this issue by solving the time allocation problem and the control problem concurrently via Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC). Our MPCC optimally selects the future states of the platform at runtime, while maximizing the progress along the reference path and minimizing the distance to it. We show that, even when tracking simpliﬁed trajectories, the proposed MPCC results in a path that approaches the true time-optimal one, and which can be generated in real time. We validate our approach in the real world, where we show that our method outperforms both the current state of the art and a world-class human pilot in terms of lap time achieving speeds of up to 60 km/h.},

The purpose of this paper is to present the basic mathematical modeling of microcopters, which has been used to develop proper methods for stabilization and trajectory control. The microcopter taken into account consists of six rotors, with three pairs of counter-rotating ﬁxedpitch blades. The microcopter is controlled by adjusting the angular velocities of the rotors which are spun by electric motors. It is assumed as a rigid body, so the differential equations of the microcopter dynamics can be derived from both the Newton-Euler and Euler-Lagrange equations. Eulerangle parametrization of three-dimensional rotations contains singular points in the coordinate space that can cause failure of both dynamical model and control. In order to avoid singularities, the rotations of the microcopter are parametrized in terms of quaternions. This choice has been made taking into consideration the linearity of quaternion formulation, their stability and efﬁciency.},

The quadrotor dynamics consists of two equations of motion, one for the translation and the other for the rotation. The dynamics for the rotational motion is fully actuated and decoupled from the equations for the translational motion. On the other hand, the translational dynamics is underactuated and depends on the rotational dynamics. In the ﬁrst step of the control design, a feedback linearization law is used to linearize the rotational dynamics. Then, it is shown that an auxiliary control input that arises during that step can be used to linearize the translational dynamics through a second feedback linearization law. The small angle approximation is not required in this design. The proposed control law guarantees convergence of the quadrotor trajectory to a given reference trajectory. Numerical results show the beneﬁts of the proposed control scheme.},

However, stabilizing control and guidance of these vehicles is a difficult task because of the nonlinear dynamic behavior. In addition, the small payload and the reduced processing power of the onboard electronics are further limitations for any control system implementation.

	abstract = {In this paper we present a quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimating the three-dimensional orientation of a rigid body. The EKF exploits the measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that is integrated with a tri-axial magnetic sensor. Magnetic disturbances and gyro bias errors are modeled and compensated by including them in the filter state vector. We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the IMU is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the IMU is subject to some angular motions. Computer simulations and experimental testing are presented to evaluate the algorithm performance, including when the observability conditions are critical.},

These three axes are typically denoted by x-y-z or via subscripts 1-2-3.  There are numerous reference frames that can be used to measure an objectâ€™s motion depending on the type of application and desired results, such as a sensor frame, a body frame, an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF) frame, or a local North-East-Down (NED) frame.  Note that in most of the ensuing discussion, the location of the origin is often neglected as it is irrelevant to defining the attitude of a system.},

	abstract = {Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) have attracted much attention due to their advantages, such as large workspace and excellent load capacity. However, their adaptability to different tasks has been limited because of ﬁxed conﬁgurations. To improve this, a novel three-DOF point-mass reconﬁgurable CDPR (RCDPR) has been designed, and its conﬁguration can be changed by adjusting the positions of multiple cable anchors. Since wrench feasible workspace (WFW) is an essential criterion that describes the conﬁguration characteristics, an optimal reconﬁguration planning method is proposed to schedule the sequence and number of all movable cable anchors for adjusting the WFW range. Based on a two-level optimization process, the method can realize static reconﬁguration (SR) or dynamic reconﬁguration (DR) of the RCDPR. If SR cannot provide the required WFW by ﬁnding a static optimal conﬁguration, the WFW range will be dynamically adjusted by DR. Besides, the number of movable cable anchors is minimized in DR by applying L1-norm optimization to the anchor velocity sequences. Simulations and experiments are implemented, and the results show that the proposed method can automatically determine when, which, and how the cable anchors move under physical constraints, and reducing the number of movable cable anchors can indeed save actuator energy effectively.},

	abstract = {In this report, we present the theory on aerodynamics of quadrotors using the well established momentum and blade element theories. From a robotics perspective, the theoretical development of the models for thrust and horizontal forces and torque (therefore power) are carried out in the body ﬁxed frame of the quadrotor. Using momentum theory, we propose and model the existence of a horizontal force along with its associated power. Given the limitations associated with momentum theory and the inadequacy of the theory to account for the diﬀerent powers represented in a proposed bond graph lead to the use of blade element theory. Using this theory, models are then developed for the diﬀerent quadrotor rotor geometries and aerodynamic properties including the optimum hovering rotor used on the majority of quadrotors. Though this rotor is proven to be the most optimum rotor, we show that geometric variations are necessary for manufacturing of the blades. The geometric variations are also dictated by a desired thrust to horizontal force ratio which is based on the available motor torque (hence power) and desired ﬂight envelope of the vehicle. The detailed aerodynamic models obtained using blade element theory for diﬀerent geometric conﬁgurations and aerodynamic properties of the aerofoil sections are then converted to lumped parameter models that can be used for robotic applications. These applications include but not limited to body ﬁxed frame velocity estimation and individual rotor thrust regulation [1, 2].},

Inﬂuence of pusher or puller conﬁguration of the propeller, number of blades, shape and dimensions of the arm, coaxial and overlapping propellers, is presented. A dedicated test bench that allows testing of various experimental setups is designed and built in order to realistically represent multi-rotor arms. Test results show that a two-bladed pusher conﬁguration is most efﬁcient and slenderness of the arm has more inﬂuence on efﬁciency than shape. A coaxial propulsion system approaches the efﬁciency of a single-prop system at high disk loadings. Finally, interference effects due to overlapping propellers are discussed.},

Omniplus multirotor designs are deﬁned as the ones that allow to exert a total wrench in any direction using positiveonly lift force and drag moment (i.e., positive rotational speed) for each rotor blade. Algebraic conditions for a design to be omniplus are derived, a simple necessary condition being the fact that at least seven propellers have to be used. An energy optimal design strategy is then deﬁned as the one minimizing the maximum norm of the input set needed to span a certain wrench ellipsoid for the adopted input allocation strategy. Two corresponding major design criteria are then introduced: ﬁrst, a minimum allocationmatrix condition number aims at an equal sharing of the effort needed to generate wrenches in any direction; second, imposing a balanced design guarantees an equal sharing of the extra effort needed to keep the input in the nonnegative orthant. We propose a numerical algorithm to solve such optimal design problem and a control algorithm to control any omnidirectional platform. The work is concluded with informative simulation results in nonideal conditions.},

Ferromagnetic materials or other magnetic ﬁelds near the sensor module disturb the local earth magnetic ﬁeld and, therefore, the orientation estimation, which impedes many (ambulatory) applications. In the ﬁlter, the gyroscope bias error, orientation error, and magnetic disturbance error are estimated. The ﬁlter was tested under quasi-static and dynamic conditions with ferromagnetic materials close to the sensor module. The quasi-static experiments implied static positions and rotations around the three axes. In the dynamic experiments, three-dimensional rotations were performed near a metal tool case. The orientation estimated by the ﬁlter was compared with the orientation obtained with an optical reference system Vicon. Results show accurate and drift-free orientation estimates. The compensation results in a signiﬁcant difference (p 0 01) between the orientation estimates with compensation of magnetic disturbances in comparison to no compensation or only gyroscopes. The average static error was 1.4 (standard deviation 0.4) in the magnetically disturbed experiments. The dynamic error was 2.6 root means square.},

Reading other books on Kalman filters and not this one could make you a very dangerous Kalman filter engineer."-Amazon.com, from a review of the First EditionIn this practical introduction to Kalman filtering theory and applications, authors Grewal and Andrews draw upon their decades of experience to offer an in-depth examination of the subtleties, common problems, and limitations of estimation theory as it applies to real-world situations. They provide many illustrative examples drawn from an array of application areas including GPS-aided INS, the modeling of gyros and accelerometers, inertial navigation, and freeway traffic control. In addition, they share many hard-won lessons about, and original methods for, designing, implementing, validating, and improving Kalman filters, including techniques for:*Representing the problem in a mathematical model*Analyzing estimator performance as a function of model parameters*Implementing the mechanization equations in numerically stable algorithms*Assessing computational requirements*Testing the validity of results*Monitoring filter performance in operation As the best way to understand and master a technology is to observe it in action, Kalman Filtering: Theory and Practice Using MATLAB(r), Second Edition includes companion software in MATLAB(r), providing users with an opportunity to experience first hand the filter's workings and its limitations. This updated and revised edition of Grewal and Andrews's classic guide is an indispensable working resource for engineers and computer scientists involved in the design of aerospace and aeronautical systems, global positioning and radar tracking systems, power systems, and biomedical instrumentation},
